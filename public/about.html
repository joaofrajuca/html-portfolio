<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 24 years old. I was born in Switzerland but came to Portugal at a very young age. I am tall (in portuguese standards) and skinny. I have really long dark hair, short or medium beard and brown eyes. My skin is more on the tanned side.</p>

<p>I like music, cars, motorcycles, doing outside activities, playing with animals of every kind and going on trips with my girlfriend and friends. I also like watcing movies and playing videogames. I play drums and love to watch documentaries and stuff like that. I also do a lot of geography and general knowledge quizzes. </p>

<p>I am quite extreme in terms of personality. I am either calm and quiet like a sloth or really energetic and can't stop moving like a dog with zoomies, specially when discussing themes that I am interested in and passionate about.</p>
